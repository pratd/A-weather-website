# A-weather-website

This application uses weather apis to generate user friendly weather forecasts. Further details on the toolkits used is follows:
Mostly Ajax with JQuery is used to call the API's. But a pure Javascript is also used to deliver the same user experience in the website.

A gulp workflow was used to deliver production version of the code as well as to host it. It could be downloaded from https://gulpjs.com/. t is a very remarkable tool which watches js files and updates them as the code is changed both in the production version and the webpage html changes.

Ajax and Jquery methods are used as shown in the myjavascript-library.js. myjavascript-vanilla.js corresponds to the pure javascript version of the same.

Further developement of the code is ongoin wrt to addition of css styles to get the prediction values.

Detail of the project timeline could be found in the document project_desc.pdf. There are lot of possibilities of development with this website with more time
